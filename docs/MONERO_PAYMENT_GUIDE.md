## 🎯 **WHY MONERO?**

We accept **only Monero (XMR)** for payments because:

✅ **Privacy Protection**: Your payment isn't publicly trackable  
✅ **Security**: No credit card fraud risk, irreversible transactions  
✅ **Professional**: Protects serious bettors who value discretion  
✅ **Alignment**: Matches our privacy-first platform approach (.onion hosting)

This is the same privacy-first philosophy we use throughout the platform. If privacy matters to you, you'll appreciate this approach.
